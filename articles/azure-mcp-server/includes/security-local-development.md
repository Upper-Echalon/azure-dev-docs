The MCP server uses your Azure user credentials or managed identity to ensure authorized access. Access is secured through Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), providing fine-grained permissions for approved users. The local MCP server is intended strictly for developer use within your organization. Don't use these tools for external applications or scenarios outside the approved development environment.
